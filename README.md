# TXExtremeEvents_Pub


This repository contains the code, data analysis, and documents associated with "Assessing the resistance and resilience of recreationally important fish species to extreme events in coastal Texas", compiled from chapter 1 of my M.S. thesis. This includes bag seine data provided by Dr. Mark Fisher and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) Coastal Fisheries Division. The bag seine data is collected and managed by the TPWD Coastal Fisheries Division staff as part of their fishery-independent mointoring survey program and data requests can be made to Dr. Mark Fisher at mark.fisher@tpwd.texas.gov.
